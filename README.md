Credit Risk Analysis &amp; Altman's Z-Score on Gruppo Rocchetta s.r.l.


By exploiting the information and balance sheet relating to Gruppo Rocchetta s.r.l., obtained through the use of the AIDA database (created by Bureau van Dijk S.p.A), I and the research team with whom I collaborated carried out an in-depth analysis with the aim of reclassifying the company, through an evaluation work about the income, patrimonial and financial situation. The analysis also included the national and local market context in which the company operates, the corporate strategies adopted and the relationship with shareholders, in particular with subsidiaries and associates. Finally, through the use of the predictive model of Altman's Z-Score, an attempt was made to make the risk analysis model more structural and efficient, in order to confirm what was developed.
